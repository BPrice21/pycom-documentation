# 1.3.4 REPL

REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and is the name given to the interactive MicroPython prompt that is accessible on the Pycom devices. Using the REPL is by far the easiest way to test out Python code and run commands. You can use the REPL in addition to writing scripts in `main.py`.

The following pages will explain how to use the REPL with both Serial USB and Telnet connections.

The REPL includes the following features:

* Input history: use arrow up and arrow down to scroll through the history
* Tab completion: press tab to auto-complete variables or module names
* Halt any executing code: with `Ctrl-C`
* Copy/paste code or output: `Ctrl-C` and `Ctrl-V`
